This assignment is a version of Baccarat, specifically the Punto Banco variant of the rules whereby the game uses only 1 deck rather than 4 - 8.
The code uses a variety of methods that link to the many classes and objects that are used to in the making of the game. The features in the game
include the ability to bet on the different outcomes of the game, being able to save play data to a text document, and comes with a full display
of the player and bankers hands to see how the point allocation happened.
